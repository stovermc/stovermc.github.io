      <h2>Advice for Mod 1 Students</h2>
      <div class="essay">
        <p>Mod 1 is intense. It is likely that you will learning a whole bunch of new skills that you have never been exposed to before. This can be very stressful, especially in an intellectual environmet, as often times this can feel like the quickest judge of your intellect. It is important to remind yourself that this is not the case. Your intellect is comprised of much more than can be taught in a classroom. Simply, the material is hard, and there is a whole boat load of it. Do your best not compare yourself to others. If someone grasps a concept more quickly than you, don't be afraid to reach out for help. I can gaurantee as the mod wears on, you will have a chance to return the favor. Do your best to help maintain a cohesive cohort. Be nice. It is amazing how much of the stress of working through a challenging problem can be washed away with a few kind words. Also, extend this to the greater Turing community. It is one of the greatest support systems I have run across and the key to unlocking it is simply a kind attitude. Outside of the classroom it is very important to take care of yourself. If you reguluarly exercise, then continue to do so. Eat healthy and make sure to get enough sleep. It is amazing how much good a solid 8 hours of sleep will do for not only your thought process, but your attitude towards learning. Lastly, dont forget to breathe. At times it can feel like the world is crashing down around you as you bang your head against the wall trying to work through a problem in your code. You are smart, you are capable, you can do this! Just don't forget to breath.</p>
